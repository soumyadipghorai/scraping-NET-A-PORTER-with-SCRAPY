This is a take-home assignment given by a company that i really enjoyed doing...

<p align = 'center' >
    <img alt = 'home_imge' width = 550px src = 'results/scraping.gif'>
</p>

## Approach : 

* Here I have made 3 spiders. 
    * spider1.py for clothes 
    * spider2.py for shoes
    * spider_all.py for both

* I have also stored the scraped data into three seperate json files for later use.

* Here I have used mongodb compass.
